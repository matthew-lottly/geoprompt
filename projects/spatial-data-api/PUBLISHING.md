# Publishing Guide

## Recommended Standalone Repository Name

- environmental-monitoring-api

## Recommended Description

- FastAPI and PostGIS-ready backend for monitoring stations, environmental observations, and alert status reporting.

## Suggested Topics

- fastapi
- postgis
- geospatial
- environmental-monitoring
- docker
- python
- backend

## Split Steps

1. Create a new empty repository named `environmental-monitoring-api`.
2. Copy the contents of this project folder into the new repository root.
3. Preserve `.env.example`, Docker files, `sql/`, `src/`, and `tests/`.
4. Set the repository About description and topics using the values above.
5. Keep the generated monitoring-status map in the README, add one real screenshot or GIF from the running API UI or Swagger as a second artifact when available, and preserve [docs/site-map.md](docs/site-map.md).

For a local copy operation, use [docs/publishing/extract-environmental-monitoring-api.ps1](../../docs/publishing/extract-environmental-monitoring-api.ps1).

## First Public Polish Pass

- Replace the sample data note with a short domain narrative
- Add a screenshot of the dashboard and one screenshot of Swagger
- Add badges for CI, Docker, and Python version
- Add a short architecture diagram if this becomes a centerpiece repo
- If those captures are not ready yet, keep the generated map asset and avoid mock visuals
