# Environmental Monitoring API

Production-style backend for monitoring stations, environmental observations, and spatial status reporting through a typed API.

## Snapshot

- Lane: Backend + GIS
- Domain: Environmental monitoring
- Stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, Python
- Includes: dashboard, health checks, typed API, optional PostGIS backend, tests

## Overview

This project shows how a geospatial monitoring dataset can be turned into an application service instead of remaining a collection of files and dashboards. It ships with a local file-backed dataset for fast startup, an optional PostGIS-backed repository for deployment, and a browser dashboard for quick operational review.

## Why This Project Exists

Environmental monitoring work often stops at spreadsheets, maps, and one-off scripts. This repository demonstrates the next layer: a stable backend interface that other tools, analysts, and applications can consume reliably.

## What It Includes

- FastAPI application with versioned API routes
- Typed response models for features and metadata
- File-backed repository for local development
- Optional PostGIS-backed repository for standalone deployment
- Filtering by category, region, and station status
- Bounding-box filtering for map-driven station queries
- Per-station threshold configuration for derived alert logic
- Summary endpoint for quick monitoring rollups
- Recent-observation and per-station observation-history endpoints with filtered summary rollups
- Observation export endpoint that can emit analyst-friendly JSON snapshot bundles or CSV extracts with threshold metadata
- Browser dashboard for quick visual review of service health, station status, alert locations, recent alert readings, and status changes
- Test coverage for the main endpoints
- Docker and docker-compose setup

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic and pydantic-settings
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Pytest

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /health/ready`
- `GET /api/v1/metadata`
- `GET /api/v1/features`
- `GET /api/v1/features/summary`
- `GET /api/v1/summary`
- `GET /api/v1/features/{feature_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/stations/{feature_id}/thresholds`
- `GET /api/v1/observations/recent`
- `GET /api/v1/observations/export`
- `GET /api/v1/features/{feature_id}/observations`

Observation endpoints accept optional `start_at` and `end_at` ISO timestamps for time-window filtering.
The feature listing endpoint also accepts `min_longitude`, `min_latitude`, `max_longitude`, and `max_latitude` so map views can request only stations within the current extent.
Observation responses also include a summary block with total observations, category counts, status counts, metric counts, and earliest/latest timestamps for the filtered result set.
Threshold updates let the API derive station alert state from the latest observation while falling back to the seeded sample status when no threshold override exists.
The operations summary endpoint returns live station counts, alert rate, a regional alert breakdown, and the five most recent alert observations, with optional time-window filters for the observation-driven sections.
The export endpoint returns either a JSON bundle with features, observations, filtered thresholds, and applied filters, or a CSV extract for analyst workflows.

Example monitoring domains in the sample data:

- Hydrology
- Air quality
- Water quality

## Why It Is Useful In A Portfolio

- Shows backend engineering beyond CRUD by combining health checks, typed contracts, and deployment-ready configuration
- Demonstrates GIS fluency through coordinate data, map display, and PostGIS support
- Gives reviewers a fast path from API docs to a live dashboard and test suite

## Quick Start

### Local file-backed mode

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
uvicorn spatial_data_api.main:app --reload --app-dir src
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

For a visual demo, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard`.

See [docs/demo-script.md](docs/demo-script.md) for a short presentation flow.
See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the project structure overview.
See [docs/site-map.md](docs/site-map.md) for the reviewer-facing surface map.
See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the next planned improvements.
See [docs/public-issues.md](docs/public-issues.md) for good first public follow-up tasks.

### Docker with PostGIS

```bash
copy .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

- The API on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Swagger UI on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS on `localhost:5432`

The default `.env.example` uses the PostGIS-backed repository when running in Docker.

### Published container image

The standalone repository CI publishes a public image to GitHub Container Registry on pushes to `main`.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/matthew-lottly/environmental-monitoring-api:latest
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/matthew-lottly/environmental-monitoring-api:latest
```

For a PostGIS-backed run, provide the same environment variables used in `.env.example`.

## Current Output

The current backend provides:

- a live browser dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard`
- typed Swagger docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- file-backed API responses for feature, summary, and observation review
- optional PostGIS-backed runtime through Docker
- a generated map artifact in `outputs/charts/monitoring-status-footprint.png`

The generated map asset is a real output from the checked-in sample dataset. Dashboard and Swagger screenshots are still useful secondary captures for the browser surface.

Primary demo asset type: generated map.
Secondary review surfaces: dashboard and Swagger UI.

## Validation

Run the unit tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Run the PostGIS integration tests after starting Docker:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
set SPATIAL_DATA_API_RUN_DB_TESTS=1
pytest tests/integration
```

The integration tests default to `postgresql+psycopg://spatial:spatial@localhost:5432/spatial`. Override that with `SPATIAL_DATA_API_INTEGRATION_DB_URL` if needed.

## Publication

- License: [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- Standalone publishing notes: [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md)
- Local CI workflow: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

The CI workflow now also publishes `ghcr.io/matthew-lottly/environmental-monitoring-api:latest` from the default branch.

## Configuration

Key environment variables:

- `SPATIAL_DATA_API_APP_ENV`
- `SPATIAL_DATA_API_API_PREFIX`
- `SPATIAL_DATA_API_REPOSITORY_BACKEND`
- `SPATIAL_DATA_API_DATA_PATH`
- `SPATIAL_DATA_API_DATABASE_URL`

`SPATIAL_DATA_API_REPOSITORY_BACKEND` supports:

- `file` for local development using sample GeoJSON
- `postgis` for database-backed operation

## PostGIS Schema

The database container loads:

- [sql/postgis_schema.sql](sql/postgis_schema.sql)
- [sql/sample_seed.sql](sql/sample_seed.sql)

This gives the project a ready-to-run monitoring-station table and seed dataset for local container use.

## Next Steps

- Add an ingestion pipeline for new monitoring feeds
- Add authentication and access control

This copy is intended to be publishable as its own repository. CI is included in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
