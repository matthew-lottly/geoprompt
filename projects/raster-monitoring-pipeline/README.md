# Raster Monitoring Pipeline

Open-stack GIS analysis project for comparing raster snapshots, flagging hotspots, and packaging change-detection output for downstream review.

## Snapshot

- Lane: Raster analysis and monitoring
- Domain: Change detection and hotspot review
- Stack: Python, JSON grid fixtures, raster workflow design
- Includes: sample raster grids, change report export, tile manifest, tests

## Overview

This project rounds out the current repo wave by adding a raster-first analysis lane. It compares a baseline grid to a later grid, calculates cell deltas, flags hotspots, and exports a change report that can later feed dashboards, alerts, or more realistic raster pipelines.

The current implementation is intentionally public-safe and runnable without GDAL or rasterio. It uses checked-in grid fixtures so the workflow is easy to review before adding GeoTIFF-backed processing.

## What It Demonstrates

- Repeatable raster change detection without notebook-only logic
- A handoff artifact for downstream review or alerting
- Tile manifest planning for larger raster workloads
- A clear extension path toward rasterio, GDAL, xarray, or parquet-backed summaries

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m raster_monitoring_pipeline.pipeline
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Generate the report with a custom pipeline name:

```bash
python -m raster_monitoring_pipeline.pipeline --pipeline-name "Heat Watch Pipeline"
```

## Current Output

The default command writes `outputs/raster_change_report.json` with:

- cell-by-cell delta summaries
- hotspot counts
- top-change ranking
- tile manifest metadata for downstream processing
