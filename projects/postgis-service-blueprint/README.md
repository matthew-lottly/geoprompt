# PostGIS Service Blueprint

Open-stack GIS portfolio project for shaping how PostGIS-backed layers become publishable spatial services.

## Snapshot

- Lane: Spatial services and data publishing
- Domain: PostGIS-first service design
- Stack: Python, SQL, GeoJSON, PostgreSQL/PostGIS planning
- Includes: sample spatial layers, SQL schema, publication views, exported blueprint artifact, PostGIS seed SQL, tests

## Overview

This project starts the next open spatial service lane after the desktop QGIS workbench. It focuses on the service-design side of geospatial engineering: what gets stored in PostGIS, which views are safe to publish, and how a service contract should look before a delivery layer is built.

The current implementation stays lightweight and public-safe. It exports a JSON blueprint artifact and includes SQL for schema and publication views so the project is useful before a full API or PostgREST deployment is added.

It also includes a local PostGIS stack and a generated seed SQL file so the sample collections can be loaded into a real database without inventing setup steps later.

## What It Demonstrates

- Clear separation between source tables and publication-ready views
- PostGIS-oriented indexing and collection planning
- Spatial service contract design for bbox and attribute filters
- Seed-data generation for a local PostGIS container
- A bridge between sample spatial data and future delivery through FastAPI, PostgREST, or OGC API Features

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m postgis_service_blueprint.blueprint
python -m postgis_service_blueprint.blueprint --export-seed-sql
docker compose up -d database
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Generate the blueprint with a custom service name:

```bash
python -m postgis_service_blueprint.blueprint --service-name "Regional Spatial Service"
```

## Current Output

The default command writes `outputs/postgis_service_blueprint.json` with:

- collection metadata grouped by layer
- service endpoints and query patterns
- publication-plan notes for PostGIS indexes and delivery options
- bounds and summary counts for the sample layers
- a generated review map in `outputs/charts/published-service-footprint.png`

With `--export-seed-sql`, the command also writes `outputs/sample_seed.sql`, which mirrors the sample GeoJSON into `INSERT` statements for the local PostGIS container.
