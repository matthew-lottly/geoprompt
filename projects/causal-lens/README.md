## Overview

CausalLens packages core causal-inference workflows for observational tabular data and quasi-experimental designs into a small, testable Python library. It integrates observational estimators, panel methods, instrumental variables, sharp and fuzzy regression discontinuity with robust bias-corrected inference, McCrary manipulation testing, and structural bunching elasticity estimation through a unified diagnostics-first API. No existing Python package covers this combination of identification strategies with built-in diagnostic infrastructure. The contribution is a compact implementation that makes assumptions, benchmark evidence, and estimator comparison explicit enough to review.

### What CausalLens Does Not Claim

- CausalLens does not claim parity with rdrobust on bandwidth optimization or the full CCT inference pipeline.
- CausalLens does not claim parity with EconML or DoubleML on ML-based nuisance estimation or heterogeneous treatment effects.
- CausalLens does not claim parity with DoWhy on graph-based identification and refutation workflows.
- CausalLens does not claim the bunching implementation matches the depth of the R `bunching` package on round-number corrections or notch designs.

The current repository now uses four complementary evidence tracks:

- a fixed public-safe observational intervention sample under `data/` for reproducible article figures and tests
- public benchmark datasets drawn from the causal inference literature for externally recognizable evaluation
- synthetic known-effect data for correctness-oriented validation of estimator behavior
- a formal Monte Carlo simulation study evaluating estimator bias, RMSE, coverage, and SE calibration across five data-generating processes

## What It Demonstrates

- Propensity score estimation with a scikit-learn logistic model with standardized covariates
- Regression-adjustment treatment effects with statsmodels OLS
- Nearest-neighbor propensity matching with optional calipers and Abadie-Imbens analytic standard errors
- Inverse probability weighting with stabilized weights and weight capping for ATE and ATT targets
- Doubly robust estimation that combines outcome and propensity models with weight trimming
- Cross-fitted doubly robust estimation (DML/AIPW style) with 5-fold out-of-fold nuisance estimates to avoid overfitting bias
- Flexible doubly robust estimation using gradient boosting outcome models for nonlinear confounding
- T-learner and S-learner meta-learners for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation with optional GBM
- Analytic standard errors from OLS (regression), Hajek sandwich variance (IPW), Abadie-Imbens matched-pair variance (matching), and semiparametric influence functions (doubly robust)
- Covariate-balance summaries using standardized mean differences and variance ratios
- Kish effective sample size for weighted estimators to detect unstable weights
- Common-support and overlap diagnostics for positivity review
- Additive-bias sensitivity summaries for explain-away analysis on the outcome scale
- E-values for unmeasured confounding (VanderWeele & Ding 2017) quantifying the minimum confounder strength to explain away the effect
- Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds for matched-pair designs quantifying hidden-bias tolerance
- Placebo/falsification tests on pre-treatment outcomes for specification validation
- Subgroup treatment-effect summaries for quick heterogeneous-effect review
- A small command-line demo that exports a reproducible causal report
- A real-style observational intervention fixture for stable estimator-comparison tests
- Publication-oriented methodology notes explaining why the initial estimator set is justified
- Reference parity tests against manual formulas and direct statistical-model fits
- Paper-ready chart and table exports for estimator comparison, balance, sensitivity, and subgroup effects
- Love plots showing covariate-level balance before and after adjustment with standard |SMD| thresholds
- Propensity-score overlap histograms for visual positivity assessment
- Manuscript drafting docs, figure captions, and cross-dataset benchmark tables for the software-paper path
- Packaged public benchmarks based on Lalonde and NHEFS so installed users can reproduce the evidence stack without a source checkout
- Literature comparison table showing CausalLens results match published reference values from Dehejia & Wahba (1999) and Hernán & Robins (2020)
- Repeated-run stability analysis across seeds, bootstrap counts, and caliper settings
- External comparison script verifying CausalLens matches manual sklearn/statsmodels implementations to machine precision
- Difference-in-differences estimator with regression-based ATT, cluster-robust standard errors, and a parallel-trends pre-test
- Synthetic control method with constrained least-squares donor weights and placebo inference via leave-one-out permutation
- Two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variables estimator with proper IV variance, first-stage F-statistic, and weak-instrument detection
- Local sharp regression discontinuity estimator with weighted local-polynomial fitting near the cutoff
- Fuzzy regression discontinuity via the local Wald ratio with delta-method standard errors and first-stage F-statistic reporting
- Robust bias-corrected RD inference following Calonico, Cattaneo & Titiunik (2014): pilot-bandwidth curvature estimation, bias correction, and robust standard errors/confidence intervals
- McCrary (2008) density manipulation test integrated as a method on the RD estimator for running-variable sorting detection
- Descriptive bunching estimator that measures excess mass around a threshold by comparing observed and smooth counterfactual histogram mass
- Structural bunching elasticity estimation following Saez (2010) and Kleven (2016), recovering compensated elasticities from kink-point designs with bootstrap confidence intervals
- Monte Carlo simulation framework with five observational DGPs plus cross-design DGPs for sharp RD, fuzzy RD, and bunching, evaluating bias, RMSE, coverage, and SE calibration ratio
- IPW standard errors corrected for propensity-score estimation uncertainty via the Lunceford & Davidian (2004) stacked estimating equations adjustment

## Current Output

The default command writes `outputs/causal_report.json` with:

- a fixed real-style observational dataset section with estimator comparisons
- a Lalonde benchmark section with public observational training-program data, using light propensity-overlap trimming for the weighting estimators
- an NHEFS benchmark section with public smoking-cessation observational data
- a synthetic validation dataset section with known-effect comparisons
- overlap summary and propensity score range checks
- covariate balance before/after weighting, variance ratios, and effective sample sizes
- lightweight bootstrap intervals for the selected estimate
- analytic standard errors and p-values from influence functions (DR, IPW) and OLS (regression)
- additive-bias sensitivity summaries with E-values for the primary doubly robust estimate
- subgroup treatment-effect estimates
- placebo/falsification test results on pre-treatment outcomes
- Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds for matched-pair designs
- external comparison and stability-analysis summaries for the exported benchmark artifacts

It also writes paper-oriented artifacts under `outputs/charts/` and `outputs/tables/` including:

- estimator comparison charts with confidence intervals
- balance before/after summary charts
- sensitivity curves
- subgroup effect charts
- estimator summary tables in CSV and Markdown
- `external_comparison.csv` showing parity against manual sklearn/statsmodels implementations
- `stability_raw.csv` and `stability_summary.csv` capturing repeated-run variability across benchmark settings
- `placebo_test.csv` showing falsification test results on pre-treatment outcomes
- `rosenbaum_bounds.csv` showing matched-pair sensitivity to hidden bias at each Gamma level
- Love plots and propensity-score overlap histograms for each benchmark dataset

## Next Upgrade Path

- add article figures, benchmark tables, and formal estimator-comparison writeups for DiD, synthetic control, and IV
- add MSE-optimal bandwidth selection for RD (Calonico, Cattaneo & Farrell 2020 approach)
- expand simulation study to additional sample sizes and publish summary tables
- add staggered-adoption DiD estimators
- add notch-design bunching estimation

Cross-sectional estimators, panel-data methods, IV, sharp and fuzzy RDD with robust bias-corrected inference, McCrary manipulation testing, and structural bunching elasticity are now in place.
