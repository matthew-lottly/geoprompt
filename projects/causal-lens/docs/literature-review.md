# Literature Review

This document records the literature and software positioning for CausalLens.
The goal is to narrow the project claim to something the repository can defend, while articulating the genuine architectural novelty that makes the package publishable.

## Claim Boundary

CausalLens does not claim to invent new estimators. The implemented methods are established and well-cited. What is new is their integration:

**No existing Python package provides a unified, diagnostics-first API spanning observational cross-sectional estimation, panel methods, instrumental variables, local-polynomial regression discontinuity (sharp and fuzzy with robust bias-corrected inference), and structural bunching elasticity estimation — all with built-in manipulation testing, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo validation.**

The defensible contribution has three layers:

1. **Cross-design integration.** CausalLens integrates observational estimators, DiD, synthetic control, IV/2SLS, sharp and fuzzy RD with CCT-style robust inference, McCrary manipulation testing, and structural bunching elasticity through a common result-object API. No single existing Python package covers this design space with integrated diagnostics.
2. **Diagnostics-first architecture.** Every estimator returns result objects that carry not just point estimates but also sensitivity measures, balance checks, manipulation tests, and validity diagnostics. These are part of the API contract, not notebook-side afterthoughts.
3. **Reviewable evidence stack.** The repository ships public benchmarks, reference-parity tests, cross-design Monte Carlo simulation studies, and manuscript-oriented exports so that every claim is testable.

This positions CausalLens for a *Journal of Statistical Software*, *Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)*, or *Stata Journal*-style software paper, not a methods paper.

## Software Positioning

Several adjacent Python libraries occupy important parts of the causal-inference landscape. What follows is a feature-by-feature positioning showing what each covers and what CausalLens adds.

### DoWhy

DoWhy (Sharma & Kiciman, 2020) is strongest on identification, graph-based modeling, and refutation workflows. It provides a structured do-calculus-based pipeline from causal graphs to estimation. It does not implement local-polynomial RD, bunching, or structural elasticity estimation. CausalLens complements DoWhy by covering design-based quasi-experimental methods that DoWhy delegates to downstream estimators.

### EconML

EconML (Battocchi et al., 2019) is the strongest comparison for heterogeneous treatment effects, orthogonalization, forests, advanced IV, and ML-heavy CATE estimation. It exposes DML, DR learners, meta-learners, and policy learning. It does not include RD estimation, bunching analysis, or McCrary testing. CausalLens covers a different slice of the design space focused on quasi-experimental validity rather than heterogeneous-effect estimation.

### DoubleML

DoubleML (Bach et al., 2022) is a specialized benchmark for orthogonal score estimation and modern semiparametric inference. Its JMLR software-paper precedent is important because it shows that a publishable contribution can be about an object-oriented implementation of established methods. DoubleML does not cover RD, bunching, or panel methods. CausalLens is broader on identification designs but narrower on ML nuisance flexibility.

### causalml

causalml (Chen et al., 2020) emphasizes uplift modeling, heterogeneous treatment effects, synthetic benchmarking, and practitioner workflows. Like EconML, it targets ML-based treatment-effect heterogeneity and does not provide quasi-experimental design estimators.

### causallib

causallib (Shimoni et al., 2019) provides a scikit-learn-style ecosystem for observational causal estimation and evaluation. It is the closest comparison on modularity and diagnostics for weighting and standardization workflows, but it does not cover RD, bunching, or panel designs.

### rdrobust (R/Stata)

rdrobust (Calonico, Cattaneo & Titiunik, 2015; Calonico et al., 2017) is the methodological gold standard for local-polynomial RD. It provides sharp and fuzzy RD estimation, optimal bandwidth selection (Calonico, Cattaneo & Farrell, 2020), robust bias-corrected inference, and publication-quality RD plots. CausalLens implements the same CCT 2014 bias-correction approach but does not claim algorithmic parity with rdrobust's bandwidth optimization. Where CausalLens differs is integration: rdrobust is an RD-only tool, while CausalLens embeds RD alongside observational, panel, IV, and bunching estimators in one diagnostic-carrying API.

### bunching (R)

The R `bunching` package (Mavrokonstantis & Lockwood, 2020) implements the Chetty/Saez/Kleven bunching methodology with bootstrap inference, round-number bunching corrections, and extensive plotting. CausalLens implements the core Saez (2010) / Kleven (2016) structural elasticity formula with bootstrap CIs. The R package is deeper on bunching-specific features; CausalLens adds the integration value of combining bunching with RD, IV, and panel methods.

### rddensity (R/Stata)

rddensity (Cattaneo, Jansson & Ma, 2020) provides formal manipulation testing for RD designs using local polynomial density estimation, extending McCrary (2008). CausalLens implements a simpler kernel-weighted McCrary test as a built-in diagnostic on the RD estimator object, trading methodological depth for integration convenience.

This table is the core evidence for the publishable claim: no single Python package integrates all of these designs with diagnostic infrastructure.

## What CausalLens Can Reasonably Claim

Against that backdrop, the repository can make three specific claims.

1. **Design-space breadth with unified diagnostics.** CausalLens integrates observational cross-sectional estimators, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, instrumental variables, sharp and fuzzy local-polynomial RD with robust bias-corrected inference, McCrary manipulation testing, and structural bunching elasticity in one lightweight library with common result objects. No existing Python package covers this combination.
2. **Diagnostics-first API contract.** Every estimator returns result objects that include validity diagnostics (covariate balance, propensity overlap, first-stage F-statistics, manipulation tests, sensitivity bounds) as first-class fields rather than optional post-hoc computations.
3. **Reviewable evidence stack.** The repository includes public benchmark datasets, reference-parity tests, cross-design Monte Carlo simulations covering all DGP families, and manuscript-oriented exports. Every quantitative claim in the software paper can be reproduced from the repository.

These are software-architecture and workflow claims supported by the code. They are not claims of new econometrics.

## Novelty Assessment

### What is genuinely new

The strongest publishable novelty claim for CausalLens is *architectural*: it unifies causal estimation across five identification strategies — observational adjustment, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and bunching — with a common diagnostic-carrying result object API. No existing Python package spans this design space with integrated diagnostics. Specifically:

1. **Cross-design diagnostic integration.** No existing Python package lets a user run an observational IPW estimate with E-value sensitivity, a fuzzy RD with McCrary manipulation test and robust bias-corrected inference, and a structural bunching elasticity estimate in one import. This is not a feature-list claim; it is a software-architecture claim about what diagnostics are accessible at each identification boundary.

2. **Structural bunching in Python.** As of this writing, structural bunching elasticity estimation (Saez 2010 / Kleven 2016 formula with bootstrap CIs) is not available in any published Python package. The R `bunching` package provides this, but Python users must currently implement it manually. CausalLens fills this gap.

3. **McCrary manipulation testing integrated into the RD estimator.** Rather than requiring a separate package or manual density computation, the `RegressionDiscontinuity` object exposes `mccrary_test()` as a method, returning a structured result. This is a diagnostics-first design choice that existing Python RD implementations do not make.

4. **Cross-design Monte Carlo simulation.** The simulation framework covers DGPs for observational, nonlinear, sharp RD, fuzzy RD, and bunching settings in one harness, enabling unified coverage/bias reporting across identification strategies.

### What is explicitly not claimed

- CausalLens does not claim parity with rdrobust on bandwidth optimization, RD plotting, or the full CCT inference pipeline.
- CausalLens does not claim parity with EconML or DoubleML on ML-based nuisance estimation or heterogeneous treatment effects.
- CausalLens does not claim parity with DoWhy on graph-based identification and refutation workflows.
- CausalLens does not claim the structural bunching implementation matches the depth of the R `bunching` package on round-number corrections, diffuse bunching, or notch designs.

### Publication venue fit

- **JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software):** Strong fit. JOSS values well-documented, tested, open-source scientific software with a clear statement of need. The cross-design integration and diagnostics-first API are a clear "statement of need" that existing packages do not address.
- **JSS (Journal of Statistical Software):** Good fit if accompanied by a longer methods-and-software paper that documents each estimator, shows benchmark results, and includes a replication study.
- **SoftwareX:** Good fit for a shorter paper emphasizing the software engineering and reproducibility aspects.

## Practical Conclusion

The package can now support manuscript claims about:

1. a unified Python package integrating causal estimation across five identification strategies with built-in diagnostics — a combination not available in any existing Python package,
2. a Python implementation of structural bunching elasticity with bootstrap inference, filling a gap that previously required R or manual implementation,
3. robust bias-corrected RD inference with integrated McCrary manipulation testing,
4. a reviewable evidence stack including public benchmarks, reference-parity tests, and cross-design Monte Carlo simulation, and
5. a compact, diagnostics-first software workflow for applied causal-inference review.

The limitations section must acknowledge that individual estimator implementations are not as deep as dedicated single-design packages (rdrobust for RD, bunching for bunching, EconML for CATE), and that the package targets breadth of design integration rather than depth on any single method.
