# Tool Roadmap

## Current Direction

Geoprompt is strongest when a tool does one of these well:

- turns a repeated GIS workflow into a compact frame method
- stays lightweight without forcing pandas-style table machinery
- composes with the current nearest, predicate, buffer, and coverage primitives
- remains easy to validate against Shapely and GeoPandas when reference behavior exists

## Near-Term Tools

### 1. Assignment Summaries

- Implemented through `summarize_assignments(...)`
- Current scope covers per-origin assigned ids, counts, distance summaries, and target aggregation rollups
- Next extension should add contested and unassigned-target summaries

### 2. Catchment Competition

- Implemented through `catchment_competition(...)`
- Current scope covers exclusive, shared, won, and unserved target summaries inside a service radius
- Next extension should add geometry-driven competition summaries on top of buffered service areas and contested-demand rollups

### 3. Corridor Reach

- Implemented through `corridor_reach(...)`
- Current scope covers per-feature corridor matching within a distance limit, corridor distance summaries, total corridor length aggregation, and Euclidean or haversine distance support
- Next extension should add direction-aware corridor scoring and weighted corridor priority ranking

## Mid-Term Tools

### 4. Overlay Summaries

- Implemented through `overlay_summary(...)`
- Current scope covers intersecting ids, intersection counts, overlap area, overlap length, and per-feature area or length shares
- Next extension should add right-side normalization controls and grouped overlay summaries by class or band

### 5. Zone Fit Scoring

- Implemented through `zone_fit_score(...)`
- Current scope covers containment, overlap, area similarity, access scoring, optional directional alignment, and custom scoring weight control with best-zone assignment
- Next extension should add grouped zone rankings and user-defined scoring callbacks

### 6. Multi-Scale Clustering

- Implemented through `centroid_cluster(...)`
- Current scope covers deterministic k-means centroid-distance clustering with cluster ids, centers, distances, cluster SSE, and silhouette-style quality metrics
- Next extension should add cluster count selection heuristics and grouped cluster summaries

## Design Rules For New Tools

- Prefer a frame method when the output should stay row-oriented and composable.
- Prefer summaries when users need metrics, not derived geometry.
- Add `max_distance`, `k`, or aggregation controls early if they change workflow value materially.
- Keep geometry normalization and CRS handling inside existing frame and geometry layers.
- Add comparison coverage when a clear Shapely or GeoPandas reference exists.

## Recommended Next Implementation Order

1. Direction-aware corridor scoring
2. Grouped zone-fit rankings
3. Cluster count selection heuristics
4. Grouped overlay summaries
5. Network-distance corridor analysis
