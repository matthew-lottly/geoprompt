# Tool Methodology

## Purpose

This document explains what kind of algorithm each Geoprompt tool currently uses and how strongly it is validated today.

The goal is to avoid overstating maturity. Some tools are deterministic transformations with clear expected behavior. Some are operational approximations designed for fast review workflows. Some are heuristic optimizers or lightweight statistical summaries that still need stronger parity checks against external reference libraries.

## Current Evidence Base

- Regression suite status: **417 passed** (338 core + 35 new-tool tests + 44 reference-parity tests)
- Validation harness: `geoprompt-compare` and `build_comparison_report(...)`
- Current reference engines where applicable: Shapely, GeoPandas, hand-built analytical fixtures
- Optional reference engines now exercised directly where applicable: Shapely Voronoi, PySAL `esda`, PyKrige, `statsmodels`, SciPy, NumPy, scikit-learn, and GeoPandas
- Current internal standards: deterministic ordering, explicit edge-case tests, benchmark coverage on `sample`, `benchmark`, and `stress` corpora
- Cross-validation suite: algorithm-level cross-validation tests against SciPy, NumPy, and PySAL reference outputs
- Reference parity suite (`test_reference_parity.py`): 35 test classes comparing GeoPrompt outputs against GeoPandas, Shapely, SciPy, PySAL, PyKrige, statsmodels, and scikit-learn

## Maturity Labels

### Deterministic

The method is a direct transformation, aggregation, or graph traversal with stable output ordering and clear expected behavior from the implementation.

### Approximation

The method is intentionally lightweight and useful, but it simplifies a fuller GIS or statistical method. Results should be interpreted as operational summaries rather than strict reference-grade outputs.

### Heuristic

The method uses a search rule or optimization shortcut that is useful in practice but does not guarantee a globally optimal answer.

### Needs Reference Parity

The method is useful and tested, but it still needs stronger proof against an external analytical baseline before it should be described as a strong implementation of the named algorithm.

## High-Risk Naming Gaps

These tools currently need extra documentation because their names are stronger than their present implementations.

### `kriging_surface`

Current implementation solves an ordinary-kriging system with spherical, exponential, gaussian, and hole-effect semivariogram options, treats `sill` consistently with PyKrige's full-sill parameterization, reproduces source values exactly when the nugget is zero, and matches multiple fixed PyKrige reference fixtures. The `auto_fit_variogram` parameter enables automatic variogram model selection via weighted SSE grid search over candidate models (spherical, exponential, gaussian). Leave-one-out cross-validation is available via `kriging_cross_validation()` for quality assessment.

### `thiessen_polygons`

Current implementation now produces exact Voronoi cells when Shapely is available and falls back to the older grid ownership approximation otherwise. Public docs should call out the fallback clearly so the exact path is not overstated in minimal installs.

### `hotspot_getis_ord`

Current implementation now uses PySAL `esda.G_Local` when the optional comparison stack is installed and falls back to the lighter analytic implementation otherwise. Public docs should describe both modes explicitly and avoid claiming permutation inference on the fallback path.

### `spatial_regression`

Current implementation is a compact OLS solve with coefficient standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and residual summaries. It now matches `statsmodels.OLS` fixtures for coefficients, fitted values, residuals, $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$, residual degrees of freedom, residual scale, RMSE, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values across noisy, constant-response, and rank-stress cases. It uses a design-matrix pseudoinverse path when NumPy is available so the current rank-deficient inference fixtures follow `statsmodels` closely, while broader model diagnostics still remain out of scope.

### `weighted_local_summary`

Current implementation now provides full GWR functionality with Gaussian-weighted local coefficient solve, leave-one-out cross-validation bandwidth selection (golden section search), and local R² computation. The `auto_bandwidth` parameter enables automatic optimal bandwidth selection. `weighted_local_summary()` is the clearer public name, while `geographically_weighted_summary()` remains for compatibility.

## How To Talk About These Tools Publicly

- Use `deterministic transformation` or `deterministic graph analysis` for direct transformation and traversal tools.
- Use `validated implementation` for tools with cross-validation against reference libraries (Shapely, SciPy, PySAL, PyKrige, statsmodels).
- Use `lightweight operational approximation` for gridded surfaces and simplified local statistics without external parity.
- Use `greedy plus local improvement heuristic` for route sequencing and facility location.
- Avoid calling the current fallback `hotspot_getis_ord`, fallback `thiessen_polygons`, or `spatial_regression` implementation reference-grade until external parity is added on all code paths.

## Required Proof Before Stronger Claims

- Broaden `kriging_surface` parity against a true kriging implementation beyond the current fixture families if additional variogram models or anisotropy support are added.
- Keep `thiessen_polygons` exact-path tests in place and document the fallback behavior clearly.
- Keep `hotspot_getis_ord` parity fixtures against PySAL local Gi* outputs and document the fallback behavior clearly.
- Broaden `spatial_regression` parity beyond the current `statsmodels.OLS` fixtures if we want to expose additional diagnostics beyond the current OLS scope.
- Keep `weighted_local_summary()` as the preferred documented name, with `geographically_weighted_summary()` retained as the compatibility alias.
- Add cross-validation against PySAL `esda` for `bivariate_morans_i`, `local_gearys_c`, and `spatial_scan_statistic` when those libraries are available.
- Add parity fixtures against scikit-learn for `optics_clustering` beyond the current cluster-separation tests.
