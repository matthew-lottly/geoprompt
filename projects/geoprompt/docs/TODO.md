- **498 tests** (338 core + 35 new-tool + 44 reference-parity + 38 P3-tool-batch-1 + 32 P3-tool-batch-2 + 11 SpatialWeights), all passing
- Reference parity confirmed against: Shapely, GeoPandas, SciPy, PySAL, PyKrige, statsmodels, scikit-learn
- `SpatialWeights` class for reusable spatial weight matrices
- Cross-platform CI (Linux/macOS/Windows × Python 3.11-3.13)
- Benchmark suite tracking 10 key tools at 3 dataset sizes

## Priority 1 — Bugs & Correctness

- [x] Moran's I numerical parity: Current global Moran's I uses a different weight normalization than PySAL (`R` row-standardized). Investigate aligning weight normalization to get value-level parity, not just sign agreement.
- [x] Local Moran's I (LISA) value parity: Currently only sign agreement with PySAL. Align z-score computation with `esda.Moran_Local` for tighter tolerance.
- [x] Geary's C global: Cross-validate against `esda.Geary` (currently only structural tests).
- [x] Kriging auto-fit variogram: Currently uses grid search. Consider gradient-based optimization for better fit on large datasets.
- [x] Natural neighbor interpolation: Current Sibson-style is 1/d² weighted, not true area-stealing. Implement true Voronoi-based area-stealing when Shapely is available.

## Priority 2 — Performance

- [x] KDTree spatial indexing: Wrap scipy.spatial.KDTree for O(n log n) neighbor queries in `_pairwise_distance_matrix`, `nearest_neighbor_distance`, `spatial_lag`, etc. Currently O(n²).
- [x] Sparse spatial weights: Replace dense pairwise distance matrices with sparse representations for large datasets.
- [ ] Parallel execution: Use `concurrent.futures` for embarrassingly parallel operations (IDW grid, KDE grid, kriging grid).
- [ ] Lazy evaluation: Defer heavy computation until results are accessed, not at method call time.
- [ ] Streaming/chunked mode: Process large datasets in chunks to reduce peak memory usage.

- [ ] **Logging**: Structured logging for debug-level algorithm tracing.
- [x] **Type stubs / py.typed marker**: Ship type hints for IDE autocomplete.
- [ ] **Plugin system**: Allow third-party tool registration on GeoPromptFrame.

## Priority 5 — Testing & CI
