# Environmental Monitoring Analytics

Analytics project for turning monitoring station observations into concise operational reporting.

![Report preview](assets/report-preview.svg)

## Overview

This project complements the Environmental Monitoring API by focusing on the analytics lane of the portfolio. It uses DuckDB to query a flat observation dataset, calculate alert-oriented metrics, and generate a markdown operations brief.

## What It Demonstrates

- SQL-first analytics with DuckDB
- Repeatable reporting from raw observation data
- Operational metrics for alert rates and regional coverage
- A second portfolio lane that emphasizes analysis instead of API design

## Dataset

The sample dataset models station observations with:

- station identifiers and names
- monitoring categories
- regions
- observation timestamps
- status values
- alert scores
- reading values

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m environmental_monitoring_analytics.reporting
```

## Current Outputs

- Total observation count
- Alert rate
- Average alert score
- Regional alert breakdown
- Latest alert stations section in markdown

See [docs/sample-operations-brief.md](docs/sample-operations-brief.md) for a sample generated brief.
See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the reporting flow overview.

## Next Steps

- Add trend analysis over time windows
- Add charts or exported HTML reporting
- Connect the analytics dataset to the API project as a downstream consumer
