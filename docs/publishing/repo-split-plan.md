# Repo Split Plan

Use this when you are ready to move project folders into their own public repositories.

## Recommended Split Order

1. `environmental-monitoring-api`
2. `environmental-monitoring-analytics`
3. `monitoring-data-warehouse`
4. `experience-builder-station-brief-widget`
5. `qgis-operations-workbench`
6. `postgis-service-blueprint`
7. `open-web-map-operations-dashboard`
8. `raster-monitoring-pipeline`
9. `gulf-coast-inundation-lab`
10. `monitoring-anomaly-detection`
11. `environmental-time-series-lab`
12. `arroyo-flood-forecasting-lab`
13. `station-forecasting-workbench`
14. `station-risk-classification-lab`

## Why This Order

- The API project is the strongest flagship repo and should anchor your pinned set first.
- The analytics project is lightweight and fast to publish once the API repo is visible.
- The warehouse project rounds out the portfolio by showing database-engineering depth.
- The widget project closes the loop by showing the frontend GIS interaction layer that complements the backend and data work.
- The QGIS workbench extends the portfolio into desktop GIS and open-stack analyst workflows.
- The PostGIS service blueprint adds a distinct open spatial publishing lane between raw GIS data and delivery endpoints.
- The open web map dashboard adds the open-stack frontend consumer for those spatial services.
- The raster monitoring pipeline rounds out the portfolio with a public-safe raster analysis lane.
- The Gulf Coast inundation lab adds a Google Earth Engine and remote-sensing lane that complements the raster work with region-scale flood mapping.
- The data science repos make the portfolio visibly broader than GIS alone by showing anomaly detection, time-series analysis, flood forecasting, forecasting, and classification workflows.

## Proposed Repo Names

- `environmental-monitoring-api`
- `environmental-monitoring-analytics`

- `qgis-operations-workbench`
- `postgis-service-blueprint`
- `open-web-map-operations-dashboard`
- `raster-monitoring-pipeline`
- `gulf-coast-inundation-lab`
- `monitoring-anomaly-detection`
- `environmental-time-series-lab`
- `arroyo-flood-forecasting-lab`
- `station-forecasting-workbench`
- `station-risk-classification-lab`

## Shared Publication Checklist

- Move the project folder contents to the new repository root
- Keep the README concise and role-oriented
- Add one preview asset or screenshot near the top
- Add About description and topics on GitHub
- Verify the setup instructions from a clean checkout
- Enable the repo-specific workflow if CI is present
