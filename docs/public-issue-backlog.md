# Public Issue Backlog

This file tracks the initial public issue backlog created across the standalone repositories.

## Recommended Delivery Order

1. environmental-monitoring-api#7
2. environmental-monitoring-api#8
3. monitoring-data-warehouse#7
4. experience-builder-station-brief-widget#7
5. environmental-monitoring-analytics#7
6. environmental-monitoring-analytics#8
7. experience-builder-station-brief-widget#8
8. monitoring-data-warehouse#8

This order keeps the flagship backend moving first, then deepens the analytics story, then adds richer widget interactions, and finally expands warehouse engineering discipline.

## Current State

- Repository About metadata is set for all five public repositories.
- The standalone repositories now each have an initial issue backlog.
- The API lane now ships filtered observation rollup summaries in the observation endpoints, a dashboard that highlights recent alert readings and recent status changes, threshold-driven derived alert logic, an operations summary endpoint, and a CI workflow that publishes a public container image. Issues `environmental-monitoring-api#1`, `environmental-monitoring-api#2`, `environmental-monitoring-api#5`, and `environmental-monitoring-api#6` are closed.
- The analytics lane now ships rolling recent-vs-previous window trend analysis, parameterized date-window comparisons, category-level deep dives in markdown and HTML output, and API-derived snapshot input support. Issues `environmental-monitoring-analytics#1`, `environmental-monitoring-analytics#2`, `environmental-monitoring-analytics#5`, and `environmental-monitoring-analytics#6` are closed.
- The widget lane now persists mock configuration across reloads, includes an interaction walkthrough asset, supports persistent multi-select status filters, and ships a station observation history modal. Issues `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#1`, `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#2`, `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#5`, and `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#6` are closed.
- The warehouse lane now includes a Type 2 station-attribute history example, concrete PostgreSQL migration notes, dbt-style model metadata, and manifest-driven contract checks. Issues `monitoring-data-warehouse#1`, `monitoring-data-warehouse#2`, `monitoring-data-warehouse#5`, and `monitoring-data-warehouse#6` are closed.
- A third backlog wave is now open across all four standalone repos, focused on API data egress and map-driven filtering, live widget integration, statistical analytics, and warehouse SLA automation.
- The real standalone widget checkout now lives at `standalone-checkouts/experience-builder-station-brief-widget` because `standalone-repos/experience-builder-station-brief-widget` is a mirrored folder inside the main repo rather than its own git root.
- GitHub profile pinning still needs to be set manually in the GitHub UI.
