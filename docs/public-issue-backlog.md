# Public Issue Backlog

This file tracks the initial public issue backlog created across the standalone repositories.

## Recommended Delivery Order

1. environmental-monitoring-api#6
2. environmental-monitoring-analytics#5
3. environmental-monitoring-analytics#6
4. experience-builder-station-brief-widget#5
5. experience-builder-station-brief-widget#6
6. monitoring-data-warehouse#5
7. monitoring-data-warehouse#6

This order keeps the flagship backend moving first, then deepens the analytics story, then adds richer widget interactions, and finally expands warehouse engineering discipline.

## Current State

- Repository About metadata is set for all five public repositories.
- The standalone repositories now each have an initial issue backlog.
- The API lane now ships filtered observation rollup summaries in the observation endpoints, a dashboard that highlights recent alert readings and recent status changes, threshold-driven derived alert logic, and a CI workflow that publishes a public container image. Issues `environmental-monitoring-api#1`, `environmental-monitoring-api#2`, and `environmental-monitoring-api#5` are closed.
- The analytics lane now ships rolling recent-vs-previous window trend analysis and API-derived snapshot input support, and issues `environmental-monitoring-analytics#1` and `environmental-monitoring-analytics#2` are closed.
- The widget lane now persists mock configuration across reloads and includes an interaction walkthrough asset, and issues `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#1` and `experience-builder-station-brief-widget#2` are closed.
- The warehouse lane now includes a Type 2 station-attribute history example plus concrete PostgreSQL migration notes, and issues `monitoring-data-warehouse#1` and `monitoring-data-warehouse#2` are closed.
- A second backlog wave is now open across all four standalone repos, with the next priority on API-derived alert logic and a live operations summary surface.
- GitHub profile pinning still needs to be set manually in the GitHub UI.
