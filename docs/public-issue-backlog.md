# Public Issue Backlog

This file tracks the initial public issue backlog created across the standalone repositories.

## Recommended Delivery Order

1. environmental-monitoring-api
2. environmental-monitoring-analytics
3. experience-builder-station-brief-widget
4. monitoring-data-warehouse

This order keeps the flagship backend moving first, then strengthens the analytics story, then improves the frontend demo depth, and finally expands warehouse sophistication.
