# Experience Builder Station Brief Widget

Public-safe TypeScript and React prototype of an ArcGIS Experience Builder style widget for station filtering, operational summaries, coverage-map interaction, and selection-driven detail panels.

## Snapshot

- Lane: GIS application development
- Domain: ArcGIS / Experience Builder style UI
- Stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest
- Includes: mock data source records, widget config pattern, coverage-map mock, summary cards, detail panel, tests

## Why This Project Exists

My public portfolio already showed backend, analytics, and database work. This project closes the remaining gap by demonstrating the kind of TypeScript and React interface work that maps closely to ArcGIS Experience Builder widget development, while staying safe to publish publicly.

## What It Demonstrates

- React and TypeScript component structure for GIS-facing UIs
- Widget-style configuration and data-source-driven rendering
- Station filtering, summary cards, a map-adjacent mock, and selection-driven detail panels
- A public-safe way to discuss Experience Builder architecture without exposing private code

## Public Notes

This is not a full ArcGIS Experience Builder export. It is a deliberately public-safe prototype that demonstrates component structure, interaction patterns, and data-shaping logic relevant to Experience Builder widget work.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the widget design notes.
See [docs/demo-storyboard.md](docs/demo-storyboard.md) for a short walkthrough script.
